# Hand me a Book

Hand me a Book is a comprehensive React application that enables users to search for and save books based on specific criteria such as subject, author, and title. The application leverages the Open Library API to provide an extensive database of books. Users can create an account, log in, and save their favorite books to their profile, where they can view details including the title, author, cover image, and the first year of publication.

## Features

    User Authentication: Create an account and log in to access personalized features.
    Book Search: Find books by subject, author, or title using the Open Library API.
    Profile Management: Save books to your profile and view details at any time.
    Detailed Book Information: View book titles, authors, cover images, and publication years.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

    Node.js
    npm (Node Package Manager)

Installation

    1. Clone the repository:

            git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-me-a-book.git
            cd hand-me-a-book

    2. Install dependencies:

            npm install

## Running the Application

In the project directory, you can run:

    Development Mode:

        npm start
        Opens http://localhost:3000 to view in the browser. The page reloads when changes are made, and you may also see lint errors in the console.

Running Tests:

    npm test
    Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See more about running tests.

Building for Production:

    npm run build
    Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and filenames include hashes. The app is ready to be deployed!

Ejecting:

    npm run eject
    Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you canâ€™t go back! It copies all configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project for full control.
